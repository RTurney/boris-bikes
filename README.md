# Boris Bikes project 

## Goal of this project

This project is designed to introduce me to working through the main concepts of programming using a pair programming system. 

The purpose of this program is to emulate the Boris Bikes system in London. 
This program will emulate all parts of this system; the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure (repair staff and so on) to form a new bike system that anyone can use.
